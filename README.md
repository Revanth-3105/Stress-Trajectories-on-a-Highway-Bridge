Analyzing Stress Trajectories in Highway Bridges Under Trapezoidal Dead Loads
Project Overview
This project, undertaken as part of the Mechanics of Solids and Structures course in 2022, focuses on analyzing the stress trajectories in highway bridges subjected to trapezoidal dead loads. The analysis helps evaluate the structural performance and identify critical stress zones, contributing to safer and more efficient bridge designs.

Objectives
Stress Trajectory Plots: Generate and analyze stress trajectory plots for highway bridges under trapezoidal dead loads.
Structural Performance Evaluation: Assess the overall structural integrity and performance of the bridges by examining stress distributions.
Critical Stress Zones: Identify regions within the bridge structure that experience the highest stress concentrations, which are critical for ensuring long-term durability and safety.
Key Features
Trapezoidal Load Modeling: The project models trapezoidal loads, which are representative of real-world conditions in bridge engineering.
Stress Analysis: Detailed stress analysis was performed using standard mechanics of solids methodologies, providing insights into the behavior of the structure under load.
Critical Zone Identification: The project identifies critical stress zones, enabling targeted reinforcement and design improvements to enhance structural resilience.
